# CoolZuul

This is an IntelliJ Adaption and Extension of the Zuul Project.

This first version contains most of the exercises of the book,
like picking up Items and carrying them around.
The world is read from a yml file.

The original Zuul project was created by Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes
as  part of the material for the book
Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
Sixth edition, David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling, Pearson Education, 2016
